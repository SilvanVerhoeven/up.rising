## Reforming StuPa: The Plan

The StuPa replacement must be worked out in a <b>transparent process open for those interested</b>. We want to reach this goal in the following way.

### Step 1: Analysis

At the beginning

- examine, <b>which committees</b> are there and <b>which duties</b> do they have (by law and in their own perspective)
- register initial <b>concerns and remarks</b> of other committees and students
- collect <b>ideas for alternative concepts</b>

### Step 2: Modelling

After that, in a small but open circle

- <b>review collected information</b>, sort and weight
- <b>think through different models</b> (e.g. student council made from student representative groups or reassigning duties)
- publish results easy to access and understand for all

### Step 3: Public Discussion

After working out the first concepts follows the

- public <b>presentation of the results</b>, e.g. in different committees and public debates
- <b>collection of feedback</b> and alternative proposals

### Step 4: Iteration

Again in the small circle, the concepts will be

- reviewed
- adapted
- evaluated again
- sorted out

### Step 5: Filter

Steps three and four will be <b>repeated until one suitable model is left</b>.

### Step 6: Writing it Down

In the small circle, the new model must be

- written down in an inital law draft

### Step 7: Discussion and Iteration

The law will be presented publicly with the request for feedback, on which basis it is adapted.

### Step 8: Voting

The final law is motioned in the StuPa to be voted on.  
The StuPa reforms itself.
